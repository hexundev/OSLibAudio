# OSLibAudio (mod) for the PSP

This is the audio part of Sakya's OSLib MOD v1, which is a mod of Brunni's OSLib 2.

Included is the changelogs/readmes by Brunni and Sakya.

This was tested with the Minimalist PSP SDK 0.15.0.

## Sample
The sample shows loading and playing a sound effect and music.

You must supply a .wav and a .bgm file for the sample to work.
To make a bgm file, use the wav2bgm tool in the tools folder with a mono .wav file.
