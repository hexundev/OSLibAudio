OldSchool Library for PSP
-------------------------

By Florian Brönnimann.
This is an easily extensible library for doing nice 2D games, apps & demos.
It brings you the power of the PSP GPU without having to learn its subtilities.

* For documentation, read Doc/english/index.htm.
* For a technical documentation, read Doc/doxygen/index.html. Then select the Modules tab for a list of functions ordered by theme.
